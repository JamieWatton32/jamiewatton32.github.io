                <h2>I'm good at math! (This is just a fun write up I did)</h2>
                <p>Honestly, I am running out things to put here, Ali. Since this is just for a project and I would never post this 
                    as my real portfolio I will just word vomit about one of my favourite areas of STEM for abit.</p>

                <p>Surprisingly, chemical engineering (Which was my displine) is actually one of disciplines of engineering with the highest level of use of mathematics,
                    with the exception of eletrical engineering and its subsets. Now this is strange to mention, but most people going into chemical engineering suck at math!, I mean chemistry doesn't have math right? right?.. Wrong. Very wrong.
                </p>

                <p>You see Ali, chemistry is the physics of the most outer electron shell, now this doesn't seem like it work matter, but you would be wrong again. Turns out the outer valance shell is the other shell that actually matters
                    to the universe and all physics happens there, womp womp. This means we ignore everything but that in chem eng, we ignore reaction intermediates, we ignore the CHEMISTRY, we just focus on 
                    the great equalizer, the field of science that makes boys into boys with impostor syndrome, thermodynamics. woo.</p>

                <p>So what does thermodyanmics imply? Well if you never taken it beyond a introductory level you may says something like 
                    "Big, complex, and hard equations". Well you would be correct, except those complex equations become unsolvable equations extremely quickly,
                    especially if you want to do, and god forbid, a control system on a fully automated chemical refining where there is in fact (to the fear of every introductory STEM student), non ideal conditions
                    So how do we solve those equations? Well you a lot of calculus, sometimes bringing the joke of "more symbols than numbers" to life.
                </p>  
                <p>So that brings me to the topic of this blog post, my favourite math classes!</p>
                <p>So there are 3 math courses that still strike fear into me, linear algebra, vector calculus (calculus in 3D space), and differential equations(Boooooo)</p>
                <p>I got pretty good at differential equations during my degree and thankfully it was the last calculus class
                    My favourite was probably Laplace transforms since they really made the higher order DEs fun. Fourier transforms suck tho if you ever have been 
                    unfortunate enough to compute them manually. I understand how important they are sure, but they will never be fun to compute by hand.
                    I definitely didn't enjoy linear algebra, but I had a bad professor who didn't will try to connect the dots to real applications. I can definitely see how
                    important they are in compyter science and I understand them, but if i ever have to compute the dot product of a 10x10 matrix ever again I will cry.</p>
                    <p>
                    Anyways thats my story of how I am somewhat good at math.
